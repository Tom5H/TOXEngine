The TOX Engine is a C++ Vulkan 3D-Engine. It has support for hardware accelerated pathtracing on RTX graphics cards. Currently it is used to explore procedural geometry generators.

** Building from source
The Vulkan SDK, GLFW3 and GLM libraries need to be installed on your system.
#+begin_src shell

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build .

#+end_src

*** Building shaders
To build the raytracing shaders run:
#+begin_src shell

  ./compile_shaders.sh

#+end_src
you might need to make it executable with the command =chmod +x compile_shaders.sh=

** TOX Engine Application development
Everything directly required to develop an application using The TOX Engine is contained within the App directory. Look at the ExampleApplication class for a working example.

- IApp specifies Application interface
- ITOXEnigne specifies the Application interface to The TOX Engine

** Third party libraries
- Vulkan SDK
- GLFW3
- GLM
- stb_image
- tinyobjloader
- nvvk (extensions_vk.hpp and extensions_vk.cpp to handle loading of extension function pointers)
